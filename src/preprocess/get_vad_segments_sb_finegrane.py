            The neural network VAD often creates longer segments and tends to
            merge close segments together. The energy VAD post-processes can be

        en_activation_th: float

            This is active only if apply_energy_VAD is True.

            This is active only if apply_energy_VAD is True.
        speech_th: float
            Threshold on the mean posterior probability within the candidate
            speech segment. Below that threshold, the segment is re-assigned to
            a non-speech region. This is active only if double_check is True.
        close_th: float
            If the distance between boundaries is smaller than close_th, the
            segments will be merged.
